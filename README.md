# Brain-Tumor-Classification

The detection of brain tumors is a task of great importance for the early diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with neurological conditions. A deep learning-based approach is proposed for automated classification using a CNN, by training the model with a dataset of labeled MRI scans to learn the patterns associated with brain tumors, is expected to get a classifier capable distinguishing between tumor and non-tumor images. Evaluating results using Scikit-learn.
